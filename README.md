ABOUT This project demonstrates how to control an LED light using a microcontroller (Arduino) and a mobile application via Bluetooth communication. The system allows users to turn the LED ON and OFF remotely using their smartphones. TOOLS:Component Description Arduino Uno Microcontroller to process commands HC-05/HC-06 Bluetooth Module Wireless communication with mobile LED Output device to indicate control 220Ω Resistor Limits current to protect the LED Jumper Wires Connections between components Mobile Phone Runs the app to control the LED curcuit connection Circuit Connection Wiring the Components LED

Anode (+) → Arduino Pin 9 (through 220Ω resistor)

Cathode (-) → GND

Bluetooth Module (HC-05/HC-06)

VCC → 5V (Arduino)

GND → GND (Arduino)

TX → RX (Arduino Pin 2 via voltage divider)

mobile app control To control the LED, we can use:

MIT App Inventor App (Custom app for user-friendly control)

Bluetooth Terminal App (Sends '1' and '0' to control LED)

The mobile app will:

Send '1' to turn the LED ON

Send '0' to turn the LED OFF
